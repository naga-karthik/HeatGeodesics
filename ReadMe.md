Mesh Processing, Geodesics and Heat Diffusion
This project is one of the assignments in the Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (COMP557) class at McGill University. The objective is to load the given mesh objects, implement a few geometry processing algorithms to compute the geodesic distances on the mesh manifold. 

It is based on the ACM Transactions on Graphics paper, titled, "Geodesics in Heat: A New Approach to Computing Distance Based on Heat Flow".
